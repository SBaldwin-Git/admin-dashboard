# Admin-Dashboard

Created using:

- HTML/CSS

# Learning Outcomes

- Intermediate CSS tools
- CSS Grid
- CSS Flex

# The Odin Project

I created this website as part of The Odin Project Fullstack JavaScript course in order to learn about intermediate CSS tools such as Grid and Flex, this website is a simple admin dashboard putting into use the tools I have been learning as part of the recent Intermediate CSS Module.
My hope is that those that view this page and my other projects as part of this course can get an idea of my programming knowledge. These projects will help to catalogue my own journey into Fullstack JavaScript development.
